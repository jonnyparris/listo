# Top Priority
- [ ] I"ve managed to sign in with the same passkey on multiple devices but I can't see the same recommendations. Why aren't they sync? Fix please

# The rest
- [ ] the compact list view should just be titles and category icons - clicking should expand to a full card
- [ ] On mobile, the search should just be an icon until you tap it to actually search
- [ ] Immediately flag if something is already saved. Even flag it in the suggestions dropdown.
- [ ] move the active vs completed selectors to be part of the category filters
- [ ] Podcast searches should use spotify to find suggestions
- [ ] when i click to share an item it should share the actual image if present, not just a link to the image. Think hard about a way to make it work
- [ ] on a mobile browser, when I hit the add button but then want to go back, I'd like to be able to use the back button on the mobile to close the form and return to the main page.
- [ ] The footer should say Made by jonnyparris, hyperlinked to ruskinconstant.com, instead of the "Made with intentional chill"
- [ ] Only show the keyboard shortcuts footer link when not on a mobile screen
- [ ] Make the logo header slightly larger without it taking up more vertical space (reduce the top padding?)
- [ ] the top menu items are not visible when using Safari desktop browser
