- [x] Failed to sync, D1_ERROR: table recommendations has no column named source: SQLITE_ERROR
  - Fixed by running D1 migration on both local and remote databases
- [x] Titles that are too long for the item card in compact mode should be truncated instead of overflowing
  - Already working with `truncate` class
- [x] make the search icon take up less space on mobile, until it's been selected for input
  - Changed from full-width button to compact icon-only button (p-2.5, 20px icon)
- [x] grid mode should be at least 2 wide even on mobile, with just images per card until they're tapped for expansion.
  - Updated to: 2 cols mobile, 3 cols tablet, 4 cols desktop
  - Grid collapsed view shows only images/placeholders until tapped
- [x] there should be a sensible placeholder image used for items without a image when in grid mode
  - Added gradient placeholders with category icon and truncated title
- [x] I should only have to tap a suggestion once for the list to disappear.
  - Increased blur timeout to 200ms to allow mousedown to fire
- [x] save images for links enhanced by Spotify
  - Added album_art to image URL checks in share function and card rendering
- [x] when i click to share an item it should share the actual image if present not just a link to the image.
  - Already implemented with blob conversion via proxy endpoint
- [x] The mobile sticky header in the top left should not include the tagline, just Listo and the bookmark logo
  - Created new Listo_Logo.svg without tagline for mobile header
- [x] add smart parsing of a title to set the category. I should be able to use a hashtag to set the category, that shouldn't save as part of the title itself. Similar to the quickadd feature of apple calendar, or how you can set attributes of a todo item in todoist.
  - Implemented parseSmartTitle() function with category aliases
  - Supports patterns like "#movie Inception" or "Dune #book"
  - Auto-detects category and removes hashtag from title
  - Includes aliases (e.g., #film → movie, #show → series, #yt → youtube)
