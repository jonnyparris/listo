# High priority
- [] the plus icon for the add recommendation floating action button is not precisely in the middle of the circle

- [] also on mobile, the icons for a recommendation are a bit too small
- [] Let's use a sticky-on-scroll header on small screens
- [] When I add-to-homescreen on mobile, there's no icon

# Medium
- [] The import export features need explanation somewhere in the app. Verify their funtionality locally and fix if needed.

- [] new optional tag attribute: "source"
- [] let's use some kind of map api to enhance restaurant recommendations
