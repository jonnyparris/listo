- [ ] Failed to sync, D1_ERROR: table recommendations has no column named source: SQLITE_ERROR
- [ ] Titles that are too long for the item card in compact mode should be truncated instead of overflowing
- [ ] make the search icon take up less space on mobile, until it's been selected for input
- [ ] grid mode should be at least 2 wide even on mobile, with just images per card until they're tapped for expansion.
- [ ] there should be a sensible placeholder image used for items without a image when in grid mode
- [ ] I should only have to tap a suggestion once for the list to disappear.
- [ ] save images for links enhanced by Spotify
- [ ] when i click to share an item it should share the actual image if present not just a link to the image.
- [ ] The mobile sticky header in the top left should not include the tagline, just Listo and the bookmark logo
- [ ] add smart parsing of a title to set the category. I should be able to use a hashtag to set the category, that shouldn't save as part of the title itself. Similar to the quickadd feature of apple calendar, or how you can set attributes of a todo item in todoist. Think hard
