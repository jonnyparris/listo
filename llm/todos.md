# High Priority
- [x] Cross-device recommendation syncing - CONFIRMED WORKING: Data syncs properly to D1 database via /api/recommendations/sync endpoint. UI already shows sync status, errors, and has manual sync button with auto-sync every interval for authenticated users.

# Outstanding Tasks
- [ ] the compact list view should just be titles and category icons - clicking should expand to a full card
- [ ] On mobile, the search should just be an icon until you tap it to actually search
- [ ] Immediately flag if something is already saved. Even flag it in the suggestions dropdown.
- [ ] move the active vs completed selectors to be part of the category filters
- [ ] Podcast searches should use spotify to find suggestions
- [ ] when i click to share an item it should share the actual image if present, not just a link to the image. Think hard about a way to make it work
