Validate completion of these with local deployment and screenshots using chrome-devtools.

- [x] Only show the delete icon for a recommendation when a card is expanded
- [x] Only save the AI condensed summary if its been generated.
- [x] The image and useful urls for an item should be included when I use the share link
- [x] Undo the 20% darken of all the theme colours - I only wanted the greens to be darkened
- [x] The compact list option should shorten the cards too otherwise you can't see as many items at once.
- [x] Add icons to the categories and use them for the category badges instead to save space
- [x] Why can't I see the RT scores anywhere? I want to see both the critic score and the audience score
- [x] When I scroll when editing an item on mobile, the categories move in front of the Edit Recommendations header bar when they shouldn't
- [x] When scrolling on mobile, add a discreet back to top button that scrolls you back to the top smoothly
