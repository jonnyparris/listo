- [] how else can i make the mobile experience feel as native/seamless as possible?
- [] more user friendly message when they've already registered
- [] the categories should be selectable from a cluster of buttons instead of buried in a dropdown to remove the need for an extra click. Make it clean and modern though, not cluttered, and still easy to use on mobile
- [] Review the layout and update anything that feels unintuitive
